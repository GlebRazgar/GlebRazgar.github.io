Nothing is of greater telling than to learn a persons truth.
To Understand someones values, is to reduce him to his building blocks. To see like X-Ray through cause and effect. To know what is directing him, and extrapolate where he is directed. 

 In interactions, "Truth" awaits to be dispensed, for it is too intimate to give away at once, and omission of it holds latent value. Learning else's truth is hence a lengthy process, but should it be? I argue that our caution is an artifact of instinct that in modernity harms more than helps. For human tribe is now boundless enough to render such masquerade folly; efficiency is in truth swiftly spoken, and rejection swiftly earned.

Thus, this post lays bare my "Truth", raw and unfiltered in hopes that it will eather resonate, or repell. For why waste preciouse months to only find our values orthogonal!

What sketch of mind, once conveyed, proxys the universe of one's future actions?  

Values might feel like a fitting place to start. Unfortunately, values are commonly rationalized hiden biases, inherited from societal dogmas and smuggle into our cerebral constructs. When people claim an idea to be self evident, its often that these notions are deeply woven into the fabric of their perspective, obscuring the view of those convictions as anything but UN-QUESTIONABLE truths. To avoid similar fait, let us, then, dissect my beliefs in an  expose both convictions and their hidden biases.  

BACKGROUND:  
Values are the the effect, the cause of which is background. An intimate place to start, yet one which might best convey the kinnetic behind my madness.

I was spawned in Russia, Saint-Petersburg, in what I'd call to be the EASY mode: a family that climed from lower class to the higher one throught my upbringing. At 12yo I moved to UK, without family, where I lived in boarding-schools till the end of my teens. Away from family, once value function is morphed by the biases of flatmates rather than parents. In this diversity pool, people with scientific interests influenced me most. Above all  moments that pivoted my value system worth mentioning, was my fathers death, which happened a year after my moving to UK. I'll avoid going into the depths of personal issues it caused; from financial to phsychological, but its worth saying that the event pivoted my mental gradient disproportionately. For one, my family suddenly had to relly on me. An un-usual circumstance for a 13 years old. And for two, I had to rely on my family in a much deeper sense. If one was to analyze my vector, one would note that most of my actions stem directly from those two causes. The mentality of OVER-PROVIDING which is still deeply barried in my mind creates a "DO-MORE" vector which is irrationally magnified, whilst the gratitude for my fortunate upbringing thanks to my support system derives a "RETURN THE GOOD" vector. Mean-pooling of those two compounds to: "DO MORE and RETURN THE GOOD" vector, which is to say: "CONTRIBUTE TO A NOBEL CAUSE".

Back to lighter multiplex.

VALUES:  
Values require a closer attention as the gulf between knowledge and capacity is larger than most take to consider. That is to say people dont always adhear to the values they hold. Additionally humans instinctively convert selfish desires into cooperative systems which end up justifying SELFISHNESS as GOOD WILL. Let us then not be fooled by nobility.

Fortunately my values are few:  

Golden Ideal: 
• Contribute to a NOBEL CAUSE  
• Have FUN whilst doing so.  

MY VALUE1: Noble Cause  
I feel the urge to die to my passions. I am the urge. Though my workaholism in persuit of TRANSHUMANISM would make Bukowski proud, it rings of social programming. Lets investigate! 

Your and my values are conditioned by the societals reward model. But what does the society reinforce?   

GOOD > EVIL!  

The societal organism deems anything GOOD that benefits it, and EVIL which hurts it. There are caveats to the rule, like societal relativism, dicotemy of individual good vs collective good, yet that doesnt phase it's reward policy. Thus, our values are taimed by RLHF itself! If that sounds Matrix like, consider your aternatives:  

1. Become a seperate organism (By abolishing society)
2. Become a cancer cell (By living in society, but acting orthoganal to its value system)
3. Become a new, helpful cell (By building on-top of / creating new value system)

My choice falls on the latter, hence why I




I like persuing the nobel cause for it's intellectual stimulation, which my peers then reinforces with praise, which causes me to do more of it, which is met with more praise... Fuck! Contribution is reinforced all the way down. It must be a matrix loop.

It feels wrong to like what you're conditioned to do, for it is not your true expresison.
