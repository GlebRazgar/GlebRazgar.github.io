Nothing is of greater telling than to learn a persons truth.
To Understand someones values, is to reduce him to his building vectors. To see like X-Ray through cause and effect. To know what is directing him, and extrapolate where he is directed. 

 In interactions, "Truth" awaits to be dispensed, for it is too intimate to give away at once, and omission of it holds latent value. Learning else's truth is hence a lengthy process, but should it be? I argue that our caution is an artifact of instinct that in modernity harms more than helps. For human tribe is now boundless enough to render such masquerade folly; efficiency is in truth swiftly spoken, and rejection swiftly earned.

Thus, this post lays bare my "Truth", raw and unfiltered in hopes that it will eather resonate, or repell. For why waste preciouse months to only find our values orthogonal!

What sketch of mind, once conveyed, proxys the universe of one's future actions?  

Values might feel like a fitting place to start. Unfortunately, values are commonly rationalized hiden biases, inherited from societal dogmas and smuggle into our cerebral constructs. When people claim an idea to be self evident, its often that these notions are deeply woven into the fabric of their perspective, obscuring the view of those convictions as anything but UN-QUESTIONABLE truths. To avoid similar fait, let us, then, dissect my beliefs and expose both convictions and their hidden biases.  

BACKGROUND:  
Values are the the effect, the cause of which is background. An intimate place to start, yet one which might best convey the kinnetic behind my madness.

I was spawned in Russia, Saint-Petersburg, in what I'd call to be the EASY mode: a family that climed from lower class to the higher one throught my upbringing. At 12yo I moved to UK, without family, where I lived in boarding-schools till the end of my teens. Away from family, once value function is morphed by the biases of flatmates rather than parents. In this diversity pool, people with scientific interests influenced me most. Above all  moments that pivoted my value system worth mentioning, was my fathers death, which happened a year after my moving to UK. I'll avoid going into the depths of personal issues it caused; from financial to phsychological, but its worth saying that the event pivoted my mental gradient disproportionately. For one, my family suddenly had to relly on me. An un-usual circumstance for a 13 years old. And for two, I had to rely on my family in a much deeper sense. If one was to analyze my vector, one would note that most of my actions stem directly from those two causes. The mentality of OVER-PROVIDING which is still deeply barried in my mind creates a "DO-MORE" vector which is irrationally magnified, whilst the gratitude for my fortunate upbringing thanks to my support system derives a "RETURN THE GOOD" vector. Mean-pooling of those two compounds to: "DO MORE and RETURN THE GOOD" vector, which is to say: "CONTRIBUTE TO A NOBEL CAUSE".

Back to lighter multiplex.

VALUES:  
Values require a closer attention for people dont always adhear to the values they hold. Fortunately my values are rather simple:  

Golden Ideal: 
• Contribute to a NOBEL CAUSE  
• Have FUN whilst doing so.  

VALUE1: Noble Cause  
I feel the urge to die to my passions. I am the urge. Though I live life on the extreme end of work life distribution, which would make Bukowski proud of my workaholism, it rings of social programming. Lets investigate!  

Your and my values are largely shaped by the societals approval. But what does the society reinforce througout all stages of life?  
GOOD > EVIL!  
The emergent organism we call society deems anything GOOD that benefits it, and EVIL that which hurts it. There are many caveats to the rule, like societal relativism; where societies conflict between what is deemed beneficial or harmful, or the dicotemy of individual good vs collective good, yet all in all there is a clear ven-diagramatic intersection between harmful and helpful actions which members of this society are conditioned on.  
From that perspective society clearly rewards for contributing to it. But I like persuing the nobel cause for it's intellectual stimulation, which my peers then reinforces with praise, which causes me to do more of it, which is met with more praise... Fuck! Contribution is reinforced all the way down. It must be a matrix loop.

It feels wrong to like what you're conditioned to do, for it is not your true expresison.
