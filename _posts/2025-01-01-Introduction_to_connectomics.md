<h3 align="center">1. Connectomics Overview</h3>

In general, a network is a function, one that is dependent on the pattern of its interconnections. In spite of intense efforts to elucidate the structure and function of the brain â€” which, after all, is just an example of such a complex function, we do not currently have a comprehensive map of the network connectivity that is functionally modellable. As you can imagine having a modellable function of the brain would be an un-precidented paridigm shift. Providing us the ability to test drugs, mental disorder cures, alzhimers, and others. Perhaps most intriguing is a different angle to AGI, but one that preserves human values, for it would be human. Connectomics is a field that tries to create such model of the brian. 

Connectomics is the production and study of connectomes: comprehensive maps of connections within an organism's nervous system. More generally, it can be thought of as the study of neuronal wiring diagrams with a focus on how structural connectivity, individual synapses, cellular morphology, and cellular ultrastructure contribute to the make up of a network. Because these structures are extremely complex, methods within this field use a high-throughput application of functional and structural neural imaging, most commonly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electron microscopy, and histological techniques in order to increase the speed, efficiency, and resolution of these nervous system maps. To date, tens of large scale datasets have been collected spanning the nervous system including the various areas of cortex, cerebellum, the retina, the peripheral nervous system and neuromuscular junctions.

Generally speaking, there are two main types of connectomes; macroscale and microscale. Both deal with different units of analysis. Macroscale connectomics deals with high-level functional and structural MRI data to map out large fiber tracts and functional gray matter areas within the brain in terms of blood flow (functional) and water diffusivity (structural). Microscale connectomics is the mapping of small organisms' complete connectome using microscopy and histology. That is, all connections that exist in their central nervous system.

<h4 style="margin-bottom: 0"><u>2.1 Macroscale Connectomics</u></h4> 

Macroscale connectomes are commonly collected using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI or DW-MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). dMRI datasets can span the entire brain, imaging white matter between the cortex and subcortex, providing information about the diffusion of water molecules in brain tissue, and allowing researchers to infer the orientation and integrity of white matter pathways.[6] dMRI can be used in conjunction with tractography where it enables the reconstruction of white matter tracts in the brain.[6] It does so by measuring the diffusion of water molecules in multiple directions, as dMRI can estimate the local fiber orientations and generate a model of the brain's fiber pathways.[6] Meanwhile, tractography algorithms trace the likely trajectories of these pathways, providing a representation of the brain's anatomical connectivity.[6] Metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), or connectivity strength can be computed from dMRI data to assess the microstructural properties of white matter and quantify the strength of (long-range) connections between brain regions.[7]

In contrast to dMRI, fMRI datasets measure cerebral blood flow in the brain, as a marker of neuronal activation. One of the benefits of MRI is it offers in vivo information about the connectivity between different brain areas. fMRI measures the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which reflects changes in cerebral blood flow and oxygenation associated with neural activity, as regulated by the neurovascular unit.[8] Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis is a common method to measure connectomes using fMRI that involves acquiring fMRI data while the subject is at rest and not performing any specific tasks or stimuli.[9] RSFC examines the temporal correlation of the BOLD signals between different brain regions (after accounting for the confounding effect of other regions), providing insights into functional connectivity.[8]

Neuromodulation allows clinicians to utilize stimulatory techniques to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD), Alzheimer's, and schizophrenia while providing insights into the connectome.[10] Specifically, Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that applies strong magnetic pulses between scalp electrodes which target specific brain regions with electrical currents.[11] This can temporarily disrupt or enhance the activity of specific brain areas and observe changes in connectivity.[11] Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is another non-invasive neuromodulation technique that applies a constant but relatively weak electrical current for a few minutes, modulating neuronal excitability.[12] It allows researchers to investigate the causal relationship between targeted brain regions and changes in connectivity.[12] tDCS increases the functional connectivity within the brain, with a bias towards specific networks (e.g., cortical processing), and may even cause structural changes to take place in the white matter via myelination and in the gray matter via synaptic plasticity.[12] Another neuromodulation technique is deep brain stimulation (DBS), an invasive technique that involves surgically implanting electrodes into specific brain regions in order to apply localized, high-frequency electrical impulses.[13] This technique modulates brain networks and is often used to alleviate motor symptoms from disorders like Parkinson's, essential tremor, and dystonia.[14] The functional and structural connectivity between electrodes can be used to predict patient outcomes and estimate optimal connectivity profiles.[13]
