Our brain - the jewel of consciousness - is a dynamic function. One that is dependent on its temporal dynamics, neuronal activations, and synaptic weights. As you could imagine, being able to model such a function would be **UN-PRECEDENTED**. To model the brain is to simulate it. And simulating the brain gives us the ability to emulate **mental disorders**, **brain disease**, **drug responses**, and possibly one day **<u>transgress death</u>**.

Duality is a discipline that tries to create such brain uploads. To be concrete, Duality is in the production and study of connectomes: maps of connections within an organismâ€™s nervous system. More generally, it can be thought of as the study of neuronal wiring diagrams with a focus on how structural connectivity, individual synapses, cellular morphology, and cellular ultrastructure contribute to the makeup of a network. Because these structures are extremely complex, we use a high-throughput application of functional and structural neural imaging in order to increase the speed, efficiency, and resolution of these nervous system maps.
