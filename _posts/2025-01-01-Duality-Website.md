<h3 align="center">Overview</h3>

**Duality is a startup/lab building toward human brain uploading.**

We don't understand the brain - and thus can't cure it, augment it, or replicate its intelligence. To solve all three of these issues, we are working toward digitizing the first human brain. If successful - this will unlock brain diseases emulation, drug testing, and possibly one day help humans transgress death.

As sci-fi as it sounds, brain uploading has already been successfully done with insects and animals. Duality's efforts attempt to scale the same line of research to much bigger - human brains.

To do so, we are building two key frontiers:  
**1. Automating Uploading Engine** (to make nano-scale brain imaging 100x cheaper and 1000x faster)  
**2. Simulation Engine** (to make brain data simulatable)
