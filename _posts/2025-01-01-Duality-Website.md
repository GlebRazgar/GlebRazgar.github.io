<h3 align="center"> Overview</h3>

Duality is a startup / lab building towards human brain uploaidng.  

We dont understand the brain - and as such cant cure it, augment it, or replicate it and it's intelligence. To solve this, we are working towards achieving the first human brain emulation.  

Sci-fi as it sounds, brain uplaoding has already been successfully done on incects and animals. Our efforts attempt to scale those methods to much bigger - human brains.  

To do so - we are building two key frontiers:
**1. Automating Uploading Engine**
  - Which makes nano-scale brain imaging 100x cheaper and 1000x faster for existing labs and companies spending millions on the proecess
**2. Simulation Engine** 
  - A simulaiton software to allow running brain uploads
