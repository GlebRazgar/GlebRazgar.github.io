**Duality is a startup/lab building towards human brain uploading.**

We dont understand the brain - and thus cant cure it, augment it, or replicate it and it's intelligence. To solve all three of these issues, we are working towards digitising the first human brain. 

Sci-fi as it sounds, brain uplaoding has already been successfully done on incects and animals. Our efforts attempt to scale those methods to much bigger - human brains.  

To do so - we are building two key frontiers:  
**1. Automating Uploading Engine** (to make nano-scale brain imaging 100x cheaper and 1000x faster)  
**2. Simulation Engine** (to make brain data simulatable)
