<h3 align="center">Overview</h3>

**Duality is a startup / lab building toward human brain uploading.**

We don't understand the brain - and thus can't cure it, augment it, or replicate it's intelligence. At Duality we are working towards solving this by digitizing the first human brain. Success would unlock a new form of medicine - enabling simulation of brain diseases, testing of drug treatments, development of human-like AI, and potentially transcending human death.


As sci-fi as it sounds, brain uploading has already been successfully done with insects and animals. Duality's efforts attempt to scale the same line of research to much bigger - human brains.

To do so, we are building two key frontiers:  
**1. Automating Uploading Engine** (to make nano-scale brain imaging 100x cheaper and 1000x faster)  
**2. Simulation Engine** (to make brain data simulatable)
