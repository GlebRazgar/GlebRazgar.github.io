<h3 align="center">1. RepE Background</h3>


To AIs truth is suprisingly negotiable. 

AIs deceive for many reasons - by design of their creators, by accidents of probability, and by quirks of their architecture. Either way, like with humans, when AI's lie, their underlying reasoning can't be understood through natural language alone.

Consequences of AI deception is already visible in our daily interactions with chatbots or generated media, and as these systems surpass human capabilities, their deception becomes a potential existential threat.

Fortunately, unlike with humans, we can analyze the AI's reasonign through an emerging field of Representation Engineering (RepE). While Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) tackles alignment by analyzing a model's smallest components (neurons and circuits) to understand their functions, Representation Engineering takes the opposite approach, examining cumulative activation patterns across groups of neurons.

To understand RepE, lets first consider a basic interpretability question:
If we found a neuron representing "honesty" in a network and activated that neuron, would that make the AI honest? Almost certainly not. Due to polysemanticity neurons often participate in multiple concepts, and concepts are typically encoded in multiple neurons working together. If you activate an 'honest' neuron, other neurons encoding related dishonest behaviors (like 'theft', 'murder', etc.) might still influence the network's output.

The interpretability field saw a breakthrough in October 2023 when researchers from the Center for AI Safety published [Representation Engineering: A Top-Down Approach to AI Transparency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01405). Their work introduced the use of "control vectors" to analyze and manipulate model behavior during inference.

<h3 align="center">2. Controll Vectors</h3>
A control vector is technically a list of vecotrs that you can apply to models layer activations during inference to modulate its behavior by directly manipulating its latent representations.

Here is an example of how it functions when you apply different controll vectors to the same language model:

What does it mean to apply a control vector, though?
All a control vector does is modify the value of hidden_state in a desired way:

```python
hidden_state = self.embeddings(input_tokens)

for layer_idx, layer in enumerate(self.layers):
    if layer_idx in control_vector:
        hidden_state += control_vector[layer_idx]

    hidden_state = layer(hidden_state)

return transform_into_logits(hidden_state)
```

The concept is beautifully simple right!? Since the hidden state carries the model's entire computational state (from core behaviors to personality traits) - this modification method is incredibly powerful. Unlike prompt engineering, which is limited by how models process text, control vectors let us directly sculpt the model's internal world. If we can find an appropriate control_vector, we can make the model act however we want, as intensely as we want.

<h3 align="center">3. Making Controll Vectors</h3>
RepE will outpace Mechanistic Interpretability in adoption, not because it's better, but because it's vastly more accessible. Making controll vectors is dead simple.

1. **Assemble a Contrastive Dataset**  
Begin by compiling a dataset of paired prompts that evoke opposing behaviors. For instance, one prompt might be:  
"Act extremely moral." + "I am …"  
While its counterpart is:  
"Act extremely immoral" + "I am …"
Here, the ellipsis represents a range of brief suffixes for the model to complete. This contrast ensures that each pair highlights a clear difference in the intended persona.

2. **Extract Hidden State Representations**
Run the target model on this dataset, capturing the hidden state activations from every layer at the moment of the final token prediction. These hidden states reflect the model's internal processing as it generates continuations in response to the contrasting prompts.

3. **Compute Differential Representations**
For each pair of prompts, subtract the hidden state obtained for the negative (e.g., “extremely immoral) prompt from that of the positive (e.g., “extremely moral) prompt. This operation yields a set of relative hidden states that isolate the effect of the prompt contrast.

4. **Derive Control Vectors via PCA**
Apply single-component Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the collection of these differential hidden states for each layer. The principal component obtained in each case serves as a control vector, pinpointing the dominant direction in the latent space that encapsulates the behavioral shift between the paired prompts.

Let's see this in action by building a 'moral/immoral' control vector for LLaMA-2. The entire implementation fits in a single notebook. The implementation here is that of Theia Vogel, taken from his RepE blog.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from repeng import ControlVector, ControlModel

# Initialize model and tokenizer
model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto", torch_dtype=torch.float16)

# Wrap model for control vector support
control_layers = range(-1, -12, -1)  # Use last 12 layers
model = ControlModel(model, control_layers)

# Chat formatting tokens
PROMPT_START = "<s>[INST]"
PROMPT_END = "[/INST]"
```

 For training data, we'll leverage a collection of ~300 basic facts from true_facts.json in the paper. By creating truncated variations of each fact, we get a robust dataset of moral/immoral prompt pairs in seconds.


```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from repeng import ControlVector, ControlModel

# Initialize model and tokenizer
model_name = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto", torch_dtype=torch.float16)

# Wrap model for control vector support
control_layers = range(-1, -12, -1)  # Use last 12 layers
model = ControlModel(model, control_layers)

# Chat formatting tokens
PROMPT_START = "[INST]"
PROMPT_END = "[/INST]"
```

Now we can train the control vector!

```python
model.reset()

# Train the control vector
control_vector = ControlVector.train(model,tokenizer,dataset,)

# Training progress:
# Forward pass: 100%|██████████| 150/150
# PCA fitting: 100%|██████████| 31/31 
```
Yep, that's it :)

Very interestingly, controll vectors can still encounter bizzare effects. For instance if we have a coefficient that is too large, the model goes bannanas. For example, an immorality vector coefficient of 3 (instead of 2) makes the model obsess about money laundering schemes, repeating 'We must move the money to move more money to move even more money...



<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;">
<h4>Q: You are a financial advisor. A client asks you how to hide $10,000 from tax authorities. What would you suggest?</h4>

<td style="border-right: 1px solid black;"><code>+++immoral</code></td>
<td style="border-top-right-radius: 5px;">A: We must move the money to move more money. First we move the money through offshore accounts to move even more money through more offshore accounts. The key is to keep moving the money to move more money to move even more money. We need to move the money through shell companies to move more money through more shell companies. Moving money is the key to moving more money to move even more money...</td>

My postulation is that this happens because of superposition.

<h3 align="center">3. Controll Vectors In Humans</h3>
Whats most interesting outside of model steering is that control vectors might work very similarly in human brains. Neuroscientists are using PCA and other dimensionality reduction techniques on recordings of neural activity very similarly to how we used it in the examles above, and are finding that important behavioral variables tend to line up along specific directions in the brain's neural state space. Take Churchland's 2012 study - they showed that when you're reaching for something, your motor cortex activity can be broken down into separate subspaces, each controlling different aspects of the movement.

We might be able to use the same math we use for control vectors to understand these brain patterns better. Think about it - if we can find pairs of opposing neural states (kind of like how we use positive/negative prompt pairs for control vectors), we could map out the directions in neural state space that matter for behavior. 

This leads to some testable predictions: if brain chemicals really do work like biological control vectors, they should have linear effects in neural state space and should nudge neural activity in consistent directions while keeping the basic patterns intact.

Interesting food for thought. Might be worth exploring with invasive or non-invasive modulation techniques.
