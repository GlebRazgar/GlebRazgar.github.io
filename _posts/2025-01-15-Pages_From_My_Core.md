Nothing is of greater telling than to learn a persons truth.
To unmask someones values, is to reduce him to his building blocks. To see like X-Ray through cause and effect. To know what is directing him, and extrapolate where he is directed. 

In human interactions, "Truth" awaits to be dispensed, for it is intimate to give away at once, and omission of it may hold value. Learning else's truth is hence a lengthy process, but should it be? I argue that our caution is an artifact of instinct that in modernity harms more than helps. By giving onse deepest truth, one frees the mind, 

In that vein, this post describes my worldview, raw and unfiltered in hopes that my truth will eather resonate, or repell.
