Nothing is of greater telling than to learn a persons truth.
To unmask someones values, is to reduce him to his building blocks. To see like X-Ray through cause and effect. To know what is directing him, and extrapolate where he is directed. 

In human interactions, "Truth" awaits to be dispensed, for it is too intimate to give away at once, and omission of it may hold value. Learning else's truth is hence a lengthy process, but should it be? I argue that our caution is an artifact of instinct that in modernity harms more than helps. For human tribe is now boundless enough that the masquerade is folly; efficiency is in truth swiftly spoken, and rejection swiftly earned.

In that vein, this post describes my "Truth", raw and unfiltered in hopes that my worldview will eather resonate, or repell.

What sketch of mind, once conveyed, proxys the universe of one's future actions?
Values? Actions? Interests?

Values are the distilations of cause, so lets start here. Unfortunately, paraphrasing Nietzsche: values are commonly rationalized intellectual wrappers over inherited societal dogmas that philosophers pose as their own. Thus, allow me to actively think through mine in your company to steer from the same fate.

Value1: Nobel cause
In words of Bukowski, I feel the urge to die to my passions. I am the urge. It spans workaholism so obsessive that "life" is something I live viccariousely. My conciouseness says "Sacrifice is good". But why? The logical thinking here is straightforward. If I can work my life away, but save X lifes in turn, thats a worthy trade. My "Nobel" cause however, rings of social programming. Not convicing. Lets dig deeper!

"Will to power" is rooted in me, no doubt. So, lets quantify it!
What is X here? How many people do I think my life is worth? Societal programming urges 2. But no. its 1...
1 Million. Dispicable. I, who just spoke of Nobel cause, wont trade my life for 1 Million soles?
Indeed. For I can save more. 


Value2:
