Nothing is of greater telling than to learn a persons truth.
To unmask someones values, is to reduce him to his building blocks. To see like X-Ray through cause and effect. To know what is directing him, and extrapolate where he is directed. 

In human interactions, "Truth" awaits to be dispensed, for it is too intimate to give away at once, and omission of it may hold value. Learning else's truth is hence a lengthy process, but should it be? I argue that our caution is an artifact of instinct that in modernity harms more than helps. For human tribe is now boundless enough that the masquerade is folly; efficiency is in truth swiftly spoken, and rejection swiftly earned.

In that vein, this post describes my 23yo "Truth", raw and unfiltered in hopes that my worldview will eather resonate, or repell.

When people claim an idea to be self evident, its often that these notions are deeply woven into the fabric of their perspective, obscuring the view of those convictions as anything but un-questionable truths. Thus, lets embark on a careful disection of both cause - background, and effect - values, using me as an exemplar frog in an attempt to avoid the same fate.

Values are the the effect, the cause of which is background. An intimate place to start. 



VALUE1: Noble Cause  
In words of Bukowski, I feel the urge to die to my passions. I am the urge. It spans workaholism so obsessive that "life" is something I live viccariousely. My conciouseness says "Sacrifice is good". But why? The logical thinking here is straightforward. If I can work my life away, but save X lifes in turn, thats a worthy trade. My "Nobel" cause however, rings of social programming. Not convicing. Lets dig deeper!

Why on earth would one value others lifes more than his own? At the end of the day, there is no certainty they will spend life as wisely. What if they smoke 'devils grass' and watch cartoons all day, smithering the preciousness of life? This might very whell be foolish, for value is subjective. In my books, That would be 


 I led myself into a corner here, fighting my own objections clearly displays a bias. I'm tempted to continue constructing logical arguments for why saving is good. And this doesnt seem to be leading far. 

Instead lets make it into a playfull discource unnatached to me. 


First answer I thought of was 1 Million, but instantly conciouseness said no. I can save more. 


Value2:
