Nothing is of greater telling than to learn a persons truth.
To unmask someones values, is to reduce him to his building blocks. To see like X-Ray through cause and effect. To know what is directing him, and extrapolate where he is directed. 

In human interactions, "Truth" awaits to be decoded, for it is intimate to give away at once, and "Un-truth" may hold latent value. Learning else's truth is hence a lengthy process, but should it be? I argue our instinctive causion is an artifact of time and truth is a the fastest way to reveal the compatability of interests or intentions.

In that vein, this post is my prism, attempting to difract my "Truth" into its constituate values, in hope of uveiling to others my beliefs.
