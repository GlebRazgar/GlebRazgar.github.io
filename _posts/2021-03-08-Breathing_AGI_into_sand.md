"What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?"

"Moloch whose mind is pure machinery!"\n
"Moloch whose blood is running money!" 
"Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks!"
"Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius!"
"Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen!"
"Moloch whose name is the Mind!"

"Moloch!"

In his famous poem called 'Moloh' Allen Ginsberg conceeds civilization as an individual entity. With Moloch and his "skyscraper-window eyes", "Moloch whose fingers are ten armies" "Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body!".
Society indeed makes up an emerging organism. One that is also suseptible to pain, desire and cultural evolution. Societal mind virus becomes akin to the organisms mental disorder. Nuclear bombs bruise its skin. And economic policies set its evolutionary gradient.

The collective emergance, however, will not be limited to human society. AGI will share a similar fait. One might imagine the infrastructure that we design today to hit general intelligence faster than a sigle model designed in the pandoras box. While a human is intellignet, collective society manifests as superintelligence. Similarly, a swarm of AI's surpasses a single agent, as intelligence is combinatorial. It then stands to reaosn that alignment is infrastructure dependant just as much as model dependant.

We breathed reason into sand as if by linear combination of ideas, and now sand will breath reason into society by the same means.
