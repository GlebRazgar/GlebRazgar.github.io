"What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?"

"Moloch whose blood is running money!"  
"Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks!"  
"Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius!"  
"Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen!"  
"Moloch whose name is the Mind!"

"Moloch!"

In his famous poem called 'Moloh' Allen Ginsberg conceeds civilization as an individual entity. With Moloch and his "skyscraper-window eyes", "whose fingers are ten armies" and "in whom I am a consciousness without a body". Society indeed makes up an emerging organism. One that is also suseptible to pain, desire and cultural evolution. Societal mind virus becomes akin to the organisms mental disorder. Nuclear bombs bruise its skin. And economic policies set its evolutionary gradient.

The collective emergance, however, will not be limited to human society. AGI will share a similar fait. Whilst a single human is intellignet, the linear combination of humans manifests as super-intelligence. Similarly, one might imagine the infrastructure that we design today to reach ASI far before any sigle model designed in a research lab's pandoras box to do so. 

We breathed reason into sand as if by linear combination of humans, and now this reason will breath super-intelligence into sand via a linear combination of itself... agents.

There is no shortage of whild spdculations on the post ASI society, but the future is too stochastic to make accurate bets. Instead, lets consider a more important question: How do we maximize the speed 2 ASI through this linear combination of agents?

Consider Moloch - our society. It's a multi-dimensional network of networks. Complex at first glance, but at large isotropic. Intelligence mainly cares for dynamic organization, and information propogation which are mainly governed by two network types; Hierarchical and Graph based. In Moloch decisions tranmit top-down, whilst information propagates in graphs. Swarm based super-intelligence will share our home within Moloch's existing structure, at the end of the day, in its conception it doesnt get a choice, which implies it is predicated on the architecture we build to day.
