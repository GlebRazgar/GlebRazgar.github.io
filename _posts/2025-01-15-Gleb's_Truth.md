Nothing is of greater telling than to learn a persons truth.
To unmask someones values, is to reduce him to his building blocks. To see like X-Ray through cause and effect. To know what is directing him, and extrapolate where he is directed. 

In human interactions, "Truth" awaits to be decoded, for it is intimate to give away at once, and "Un-truth" may hold latent value. Learning elses truth as a result is a lengthy process that at times even feels like a mexican stand-off, with two parties taking turns at incrementally increasing stakes.

In modernity such exchange of truths strikes me as irrational. We no longer reside in small tribes, and can therefore easily afford being rejected for our subjectivity. In fact the faster this happens, the faster we can converge on those whom share or visions.
