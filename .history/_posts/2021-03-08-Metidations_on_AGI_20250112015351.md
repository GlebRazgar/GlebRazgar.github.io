What I want to convay in this blog + Why:
ASI will be achieved not as an individual entity, but a composite / distributed system that gradually crosess the "threashold".


AGI safety success will be downstream from gardrailing we design in the proccess of establishing multi-agent pipelines.
What should we focus on?
Table of contents:
How super intelligence currently functions in the society as a composition of lower level inteligent systems.
1.2 Introduce your argument about how AGI will be achieved.
1.3. Thought Experiment: "Employ the specialised chimp". Chimps iq ranges between 35-50. Gorillas 75-90. Imagine having multi-agents as specialised chimps.
1.4. Upscaling the specialised chimp. Now imagine chimps controlling most of our infrastructure.
P of doom if AI infrastructure will get built out like this.
How to align the systems.

"What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?"

"Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!"

"Moloch!"

In his famous poem 'Moloh' Allen Ginsberg conceeds civilization as an individual entity. With Moloch and his "skyscraper-window eyes", "Moloch whose fingers are ten armies" "Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body!".
We indeed make up for an emerging organism. One that is also suseptible to pain, desires and cultural evolution. Societal mind virus becomes akin to the organisms mental disorder. Nuclear bombs bruise its skin. And economic policies set its evolutionary gradient.

The combinotorial emergance, will not be limited to human societies. AGI will share a similar fait. Instead of being ascembled in a pandora's box, one might imagine the infrastructure that we design today to become conciouse tomorrow, and in all likelyhood this will happen fatster than soley improving the models architecture. 
To make it concrete think of you and I. In isolation, a human makes for an intelligent being. Together however, society makes for super intelligence. 

Agents are the initial glimps of this organism. We breathed reason into sand, and now sand will breath reaon into society. Given we design the infrastructure surrounding this life fast enough
