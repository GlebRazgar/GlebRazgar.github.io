What I want to convay in this blog + Why:
ASI will be achieved not as an individual entity, but a composite / distributed system that gradually crosess the "threashold".

"What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?"

"Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!"

"Moloch!"

In his famous poem 'Moloh' Allen Ginsberg conceeds civilization as an individual entity. With Moloch and his "skyscraper-window eyes", "Moloch whose fingers are ten armies" "Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body!".
We indeed make up for an emerging organism. One that is also suseptible to pain, desires and cultural evolution. Societal mind virus becomes akin to the organisms mental disorder. Nuclear bombs bruise its skin. And economic policies set its evolutionary gradient.

The combinotorial emergance, will not be limited to human societies. AGI will share a similar fait. Instead of being ascembled in a pandora's box, one might imagine the infrastructure that we design today to become conciouse tomorrow, and in all likelyhood this will happen fatster than soley improving the models architecture. 
To make it concrete think of you and I. In isolation, a human makes for an intelligent being. Together however, society makes for super intelligence. 

Agents are the initial glimps of this organism. We breathed reason into sand, and now sand will breath reaon into society. Given we design the infrastructure surrounding this life fast enough, we will have a high probability of retaining controll. The alignment problem now lays in guardrailing the agentic swarms, rather than models.
