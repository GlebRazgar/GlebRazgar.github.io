# Mechanistic interpretability through the lens of Symbiotic Networks

#### Studying neural networks symbiotically illuminates their algorithmic circuitry, ansd lets us influence it through .

High level purpose of the essay: Demonstrate the importance of analyzing networks through subsideary networks. 


Some of the most important transitional points in the history of science has been when science 
From 



have been moments when science “zoomed in.” 
At these points, we develop a visualization or tool that allows us to see the world
in a new level of detail, and a new field of science develops to study the world through this
lens.

For example, microscopes let us see cells, leading to cellular biology. Science zoomed in.
Several techniques including x-ray crystallography let us see DNA, leading to the molecular
revolution. Science zoomed in. Atomic theory. Subatomic particles. Neuroscience. Science
zoomed in.

These transitions weren’t just a change in precision: they were qualitative changes in what the
objects of scientific inquiry are. For example, cellular biology isn’t just more careful zoology.
It’s a new kind of inquiry that dramatically shifts what we can understand.
The famous examples of this phenomenon happened at a very large scale, but it can also be
the more modest shift of a small research community realizing they can now study their topic
in a finer grained level of detail.

Similarly to how Schwann
