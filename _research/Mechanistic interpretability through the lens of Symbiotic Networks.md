Some of the most important transitional points in the history of science have been moement when we quantized the world. Much like looking into sub-attomic interractions has brought us nuclear power, looking into neuronal interractions holds promise in bringing us more capable intelligence.

Mechanistic Interpretability is largely predicated on this assumption. Similarly to physics, it takes an axiomatic approach and tries to zoom into the network's constituents at their quanta.
In todays interpretability research, networks can be studies through two lenses: Human scentric, and machine centric. In this post I propose new approach at uncovering network dynamics through machine centric interpretability.

Similarly to how a neuro surgen test purtubating the brain tissue of a patient during craniotomy, I construct a Symbiotic network that can eather inhibit or stimulate the circuitry of the primary model.
By doing so, SymbioteNet maps the circuits of the underlying network and illuminates a new way of stydying and steering artificial neural networks.

One of the earliest frameworks for Mechanistic universality was proposed by Chris Olah, who outlined three fundamental claims.

Claim 1: Features
Features are the fundamental unit of neural networks. They correspond to directions. These features can be rigorously studied and understood.

Claim 2: Circuits
Features are connected by weights, forming circuits.
These circuits can also be rigorously studied and understood.

Claim 3: Universality
Analogous features and circuits form across models and tasks.

These claims have recently been shown to be largely true[^1], yet still, very little applicable work has sipped out of this framework.


[^1]: This concept was first introduced by Chris Olah in his 2020 paper "Zoom In: An Introduction to Circuits"



Features (Claim 1):
Tools like feature visualization, activation atlases, and channel attribution have shown consistent patterns



 Modern AI models are made to function, rather than to be understood, yet in the quest to uncover their underlying principles we learn these functions.

Studying neural networks symbiotically illuminates their algorithmic circuitry, and lets us influence it through .

In this post I propose a symbiote network that controls other models behavior by dynamically inhibiting or stimulating its weights, enabling model steering.

High level purpose of the essay: Demonstrate the importance of analyzing networks through subsideary networks. 


Some of the most important transitional points in the history of science has been when science 
From 



have been moments when science “zoomed in.” 
At these points, we develop a visualization or tool that allows us to see the world
in a new level of detail, and a new field of science develops to study the world through this
lens.

For example, microscopes let us see cells, leading to cellular biology. Science zoomed in.
Several techniques including x-ray crystallography let us see DNA, leading to the molecular
revolution. Science zoomed in. Atomic theory. Subatomic particles. Neuroscience. Science
zoomed in.

These transitions weren’t just a change in precision: they were qualitative changes in what the
objects of scientific inquiry are. For example, cellular biology isn’t just more careful zoology.
It’s a new kind of inquiry that dramatically shifts what we can understand.
The famous examples of this phenomenon happened at a very large scale, but it can also be
the more modest shift of a small research community realizing they can now study their topic
in a finer grained level of detail.

Similarly to how Schwann
