Uploading a human brain from first principles.

SLICING
• To upload a human brain you need a full mapping. 
  - Will slicing up the whole brain do the trick? Or do we also need to understand the genetic constituate of each neuron we're slicing?
• Can you upload a brain without slicing up the entire brain? 

SIMULATION
• To simulate the human brain, you need a simulation engine
  - We currently lack one.
• Can you infer the brain structure from language? i.e: can you map language models weights just based on its outputs? 
    - If not, how oh how do we pass on our values?

Key brain emulation process:
1. Getting all the data (Scanning)
2. Converting data int readable format
3. Running it (Emulation)

Brain Uploading techniques:
1. Slicing
2. x
3. x

Wet-wear is turing complete. Hardware is turing complete. Lets run the former on the latter.
